<p class="text2">How interesting is it for teenagers to read about the problems of an adult orphan billionaire or a super strong alien? For many years they did just that, but the teenagers themselves in the comics have always been nothing more than sidekicks of the main character. Take, for example, Robin or Bucky. But everything changed in the early 60s of the last century, when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko introduced an ordinary teenager Peter Parker to the world. And despite the fact that he was bitten by a radioactive spider, and now he has amazing abilities (spider sense, the ability to climb walls and his cartridges shooting cobwebs), it was primarily a teenager with all the age-related problems.</p>
